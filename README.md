# SDD — a spec-driven development workspace

A reusable starter for building software with an agent fleet on a leash: **specs before code, small
verifiable increments, a check at every seam, and a human at every gate.**

It combines three things:

- **[OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev)** as the planning surface — capability specs, change proposals,
  deltas, and an archive step that folds applied changes back into the living spec.
- **A seven-agent fleet** — `pm`, `architect`, `dev`, `code-reviewer`, `qa-manager`, `qa`, `devops` —
  each with a charter and a verification contract it must satisfy before work advances.
- **Right-sizing**, so the process fits the change. The most common way spec-driven development fails
  is a one-line fix arriving with four user stories and sixteen acceptance criteria; three tracks exist
  precisely to prevent that.

Works with **opencode** and **Claude Code** from the same source. Anything else that reads `AGENTS.md`
gets the harness too.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <this> my-project && cd my-project
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest    # needs Node 20.19+

# 1. Declare the stack. Nothing technical happens before this.
$EDITOR openspec/project.md

# 2. Start working.
opencode                                      # or: claude
```

Then, in the session:

```
/kickoff   build a service that ingests webhooks and exposes a search API
```

Four commands drive the loop:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/board` | Shows what is in flight, what has drifted, what is unarchived |
| `/track <request>` | Right-sizes a request into Direct / Light / Full before any work starts |
| `/kickoff [goal]` | Starts a cycle and runs the fleet loop from Gate A |
| `/gate <A\|B\|C\|D>` | Presents a gate to you in the four-part format, then stops |

And the OpenSpec workflows underneath them:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/opsx-propose "<name>"` | Creates a change and all its artifacts — planning only, never code |
| `/opsx-apply` | Implements the approved change |
| `/opsx-archive` | Folds the delta into `openspec/specs/` |
| `/opsx-explore`, `/opsx-update`, `/opsx-sync` | Investigate, revise, reconcile |

In Claude Code the `opsx` commands are namespaced: `/opsx:propose`.

## How the loop runs

```
 intent ─► TRACK ─► /opsx-propose ─► GATE B ─► /opsx-apply ─► review ─► GATE C
              │       (+ test plan)              (dev)                    │
           GATE A                                                       merge
        (Track 2 only)                                                    │
                                                                         qa
                                                                          │
                                        GATE D ─► deploy ─► /opsx-archive
                                      (Track 2 only)              │
                                                         specs/ updated
```

### The three tracks

| | **Direct** | **Light** | **Full** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **For** | Trivially reversible, no observable change | One capability, no new interface | New capability, cross-cutting, security or data path, migration |
| **Artifacts** | None | proposal + spec delta + tasks | + design |
| **Gates** | None | B, C | A, B, C, D |

Escalating a track is any agent's call. Lowering one is yours alone, at a gate — it removes a check.
Security, data loss, money, and identity are never below Full, whatever the diff size.

### The four gates

- **A — Intent and track.** Scope, goal, tracks, what is out of scope.
- **B — Spec, design, and test plan.** *The highest-leverage gate.* A wrong spec approved here costs a
  hundred times what it costs to fix now.
- **C — Merge.** After the reviewer approves.
- **D — Deploy.** After a green, gated pipeline.

Every gate gets the same four things: what was done, the evidence, what happens next, and the risks.
Then the fleet stops and waits.

## Spec-anchored, deliberately

There are three levels of spec-driven development, and confusing them is where most arguments start:

1. **Spec-first** — specs written before code, then discarded.
2. **Spec-anchored** — specs written before code and **kept**, evolving with the capability. ← *here*
3. **Spec-as-source** — specs are the editable artifact; code is generated and marked do-not-edit.

This workspace sits at level 2. `openspec/specs/` holds the living truth, `openspec/changes/<name>/`
holds a proposed delta, and `openspec archive` folds an applied delta back in. **Code stays a
first-class, human-reviewed artifact** — nobody reviews a spec instead of reviewing the diff.

Level 3 is out of scope on purpose: generating code from prose combines the rigidity of model-driven
development with the non-determinism of a language model, and inherits the downsides of both.

## Layout

```
AGENTS.md                  The harness. Read by opencode and anything AGENTS.md-aware.
CLAUDE.md                  Imports AGENTS.md, so Claude Code reads the same contract.
opencode.json              opencode project config — instructions and tool permissions.

openspec/
  project.md               ← THE STACK DECLARATION. Fill this in first.
  config.yaml              Artifact rules the propose workflow enforces.
  specs/                   Living capability specs. Generated by archive; never hand-edited.
  changes/                 Changes in flight, and changes/archive/ once shipped.

harness/                   ← THE ONLY PLACE YOU EDIT agents, skills, and commands.
  agents/                  Seven charters, tool-neutral.
  skills/                  Seventeen skills, from spec conventions to incident response.
  commands/                board, track, gate, kickoff.

scripts/sync-harness.mjs   Distributes harness/ to .claude/ and .opencode/.
docs/adr/                  Architecture decision records, with the process and template.

.claude/ .opencode/        GENERATED. Committed so a fresh clone works with no build step.
```

### Editing the harness

```bash
$EDITOR harness/agents/dev.md
node scripts/sync-harness.mjs
```

`harness/` is canonical. The copies under `.claude/` and `.opencode/` are generated — edit those and
the next sync overwrites them. Agent charters carry tool-neutral frontmatter, which the script
transforms per tool: Claude Code gets `tools:` and a `model:` resolved from `model-tier`, opencode gets
`mode:` and a `permission:` map.

The `opsx-*` commands and `openspec-*` skills come from `openspec init` and are **not** owned by the
sync script. Refresh them with `openspec update`.

### Choosing models in opencode

The charters carry a `model-tier` — `high` for `architect`, `dev`, and `code-reviewer`, `standard` for
the rest. opencode resolves models from `opencode.json` rather than from the charter, so that a
workspace pointed at a different provider is not overridden. To pin them:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "architect": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514" },
    "qa": { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514" }
  }
}
```

## The skills

Loaded on demand by whichever agent's charter names them.

| Skill | For |
|---|---|
| `sdd-workflow` | The tracks, the gates, and how OpenSpec maps onto them |
| `spec-conventions` | Change naming, delta discipline, acceptance criteria, traceability |
| `stack-conventions` | Enforcing what `openspec/project.md` declares |
| `supply-chain-pipeline` | build → gate → sign → deploy, SBOM, no-rebuild rollback |
| `clean-code` | The full Clean Code catalog, language-neutral |
| `testing-strategy` | Test levels, and *guards that cannot fail* |
| `code-review` | Security, performance, correctness review method |
| `architecture`, `system-design` | ADRs, trade-offs, boundaries, API and data modeling |
| `debug`, `documentation` | Structured diagnosis; READMEs, runbooks, API docs |
| `deploy-checklist`, `incident-response` | Pre-deploy verification; rollback and postmortems |
| `quality-lens`, `frontend-ui-ux`, `apple-design` | UI critique, craft, and platform conventions |
| `unslop` | Removing the tells from generated prose |

## Safety rails

- **`openspec/specs/` is write-protected** by a PreToolUse hook. Deltas go in
  `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`; the archive folds them in. Set `OPENSPEC_ALLOW_SPEC_EDIT=1` to
  correct genuine drift, deliberately.
- **`.claude/hooks/guard-shared-checkout.mjs`** is shipped but **not wired in**. Turn it on once agents
  run in per-agent git worktrees; with a single shared checkout it denies every write.
- **Destructive git is denied** by default: `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`.

Both hooks are Node, not `bash` + `jq`. Node is already required here (the OpenSpec CLI needs it) while
`jq` is absent on plenty of machines — and a fail-closed guard whose only dependency is missing denies
every write in the repo, which reads as a broken workspace rather than as protection.

## Background

- OpenSpec — <https://openspec.dev/docs/installation>
- Birgitta Böckeler, *Exploring Gen AI: Spec-driven development — tools* —
  <https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html>

The right-sizing tracks, the deliberate choice of spec-anchored over spec-as-source, and the pressure to
keep artifacts lean all come from the second. Its central criticisms — process disproportionate to the
change, a review burden nobody can sustain, and the false sense of control that elaborate checklists
create — are the failure modes this workspace is shaped to avoid.
